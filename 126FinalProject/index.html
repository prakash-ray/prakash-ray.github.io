        <h2 style="padding-bottom:30px">Welcome to Ichiraku Ramen!</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">
            We are a Japanese ramen shop and izakaya (Japanese pub) in Downtown Durham, North Carolina.
            Centering on exquisite ramen noodle bowls, our menu also features innovative small plates
            and unique desserts. Enjoy steaming noodle bowls and appetizers in our first
            floor ramen shop and choose from our carefully curated selection.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">
            Our first floor ramen shop is a cozy dining experience featuring an open kitchen where steamy bowls
            of ramen are assembled steps away from your table! For those only familiar with the instant ramen or cup
            noodles
            that commonly fuel college students, Ichiraku Ramen's steaming bowls of ramen are a far cry from their
            plastic
            packaged counterparts but house the same comfort.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">
            An izakaya is essentially a Japanese pub, offering a variety of appetizers to accompany beer, sake,
            cocktails
            and the like. Our izakaya, located on the second story of our restaurant, is a speakeasy bar, which features
            a
            wide selection of Japanese whisky, shochus, and bourbon selection.
            Confused of which drink to order? Ask our experienced staff! They are happy to guide you through the menu!

            All recipes are hand crafted by the owner John Mulaney, who has over 20 years of experience in the Japanese
            restaurant industry.
